         * Homework #3 - Conditional Statements
         *
         * Assignment #1
         * 1.) Create an int variable with the value of 75 (you can choose any variable name).
         * 2.) Write an if/else statement to determine whether our int variable is an even or odd number.
         * Hint: The modulo or remainder operator % gives you the remainder when one number is divided by another. Think about how this can help you determine whether a number is even or odd.
         * 3.) If our int variable is even, print out "It's an even number", otherwise  display "It's an odd number".
         * 4.) Next, let's update the value of the int variable to 346 (an even number), and the output should be correct.
         *
         * - Congratulations on your first simplified Unit Test! (this is how we test
         * our own code)

         * Assignment #2
         * 1.) Declare an int variable named 'day' and initialize it with a value of 1.
         * Example: int day = 1;
         * 2.) Write a switch case statement to determine the day of the week based on the value of our int variable value.
         * 3.) Use the switch case to handle different values of the 'day' int variable.
         * If the value of 'day' is 1, print out "It's Sunday"
         * If the value of 'day' is 2, print out "It's Monday"
         * Continue this pattern for the other days of the week
         * 4.) Next, let's change the value of the int variable to 6, and it should print out the correct result.
         * Example: ("Its Friday")

         * Instructions:
         * 1.) For our optional homework (not required), let's try and create a homework grading system.
         * 2.) Declare an int variable named 'grade' and initialize it with a value of 80.
         * Example: int grade = 80;
         * 3.) Next, let's create an if - else - if statement to check the value of our int variable 'grade'.
         * 4.) Using our Comparison & Logical Operators (from the lesson) in the if else if statements:
         * 5.) If our grade ranges from 90-100, print out
         * "Excellent! Your homework grade is A!"
         * 6.) Next condition, if our grade ranges from 80-89, print out
         * "Great work! Your homework grade is B!"
         * 7.) Next condition, if our grade ranges from 70-79, print out
         * "Improvement needed! Your homework grade is C!"
         * 8.) Next condition, if our grade ranges from 60-69, print out
         * "Close fail, try harder! Your homework grade is D!"
         * 9.) Next condition, if our grade ranges from 0-59, print out
         * "Sorry, failed, let's try again! Your homework grade is F!"
         * 10.) For our else statement, if the grade value is not within the specified grade conditions/ranges, print "Invalid homework grade!"
         * Note: Below is a sample syntax of the if-else-if statement for reference:
         *
         * if (condition1) {
         * // Code block for condition1
         * } else if (condition2) {
         * // Code block for condition2
         * } else if (condition3) {
         * // Code block for condition3
         * } else {
         * // Code block for the else statement
         * }
         *
         * 11.) Let's change the int grade value and try out each of the conditions for the homework grade A-F, and the else statement
