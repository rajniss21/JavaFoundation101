    Homework #8 - OOP Principles

    Instructions:
    1.) Create a new Java class named BaseElement for the web elements; this will be our base class.
    2.) Create two new Java classes named LinkElement and TextElement, these two classes should inherit the BaseElement class.
    Example: class LinkElement extends BaseElement
    3.) Declare a String variable named 'locator' with value of "//*[id='some-id']" in BaseElement class, the locator will be inherited by both LinkElement and TextElement classes.
    4.) Create a method named 'click()' in both the LinkElement and TextElement classes.
    5.) Inside the 'click()' methods of both classes, print the 'locator' String variable inherited from the BaseElement class.
    6.) In the 'click()' method of the TextElement class, print the message "clicked on an element". This message is valid for text-based elements.
    7.) In the 'click()' method of the LinkElement class, print "clicked and redirected" when clicking on a link, as links typically redirect to other pages.
    8.) This is a simplified version of a framework structure that will be covered in detail when we start Selenium.
    9.) In our Main.java class, create objects for both the LinkElement and TextElement classes.
    10.) Call the click() methods for both classes, what principle is that?
    11.) It should also print out both locators, what is displayed in our console, and which OOP principle is that?
